# Hark

## Run hark designer files
**Note** `.n` files have to be made executable with `chmod +x` to launch them  

    batchflow *.n

## Todo

 1. 2Mics a 1channel -> 1Mic a 2 Channels 
    - Probably not easily possible within hark or with standard hark nodes. Tried nodes
 2. Integrate binaural localisation into kinect example
 3. Create tf for 2Mic setup location (harktool4 or 5)
 4. Read data from ROS node
